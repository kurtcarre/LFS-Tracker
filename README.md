# LFS Tracker

A web based system for tracking which packages you have install to your LFS install.

### What if I have multiple LFS installs?
No problem! This system can track multiple LFS instances.

### But my LFS installs are different versions!
No problem! We track which LFS version each package and LFS instance is for.

### What's the catch?
We don't have data for the files and directories installed by each package. This is best used to track which packages in the LFS / BLFS books you have installed. Use it to keep track of where you are in each book!
We do track which packages are core LFS packages though (i.e. are part of the core LFS book)!
